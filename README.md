# MHW-Save-Editor
For research into the save file structure and modding in general visit the Monster Hunter World Modding Discord: https://discord.gg/gJwMdhK  
We are currently looking for code writers to implement additional sections that have already been mapped out.  
  
This is a MHW Save Editor. For the time being it allows changing the steam id (in case you want to use someone else's save) and editing the investigation list.
